This update adds the Assistant service.

In addition, the following services have been updated to support their latest release. Note that some APIs have changed in order to improve uniformity between the Watson SDKs.

- Conversation
- Language Translator
- Natural Language Classifier
- Natural Language Understanding
- Personality Insights
- Text to Speech
- Tone Analyzer
- Visual Recognition

The following deprecated services have also been removed from the SDK:

- AlchemyDataNewsV1
- AlchemyLanguageV1
- AlchemyVisionV1
- DialogV1

## Version 0.21.0
_2018-02-01_

- Change uses of `NSLocalizedFailureReasonErrorKey` to `NSLocalizedDescriptionKey` for Linux compatibility

## Version 0.20.0
_2018-01-17_

This release extracts Starscream to be an _external_ dependency. Starscream adds support for WebSockets sessions and is required for use with the Speech to Text service. Because it is an _external_ dependency, developers using the SDK must now link and embed it in their projects. For more information, see [Readme: Speech to Text](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/swift-sdk#speech-to-text).

This release also includes the following additional changes:
- Deprecate Document Conversion

## Version 0.8.1

_2016-10-12_

This release updates the Swift 2.3 version of the iOS SDK with several bug fixes and minor changes.

- All Services: Default HTTP headers can now be set for each service.

- All Services: The service URL parameter was moved from each `init` to a class property. To set a custom service URL parameter, set the class property instead of passing it as a parameter to the initializer. (For example: `textToSpeech.serviceURL = "..."`.)

- Credentials: Testing credentials were moved to a .swift file for convenience.

- Language Translator: Update the default service URL for the recent release of the Language Translator service. To use an existing Language Translation service, specify a custom service URL.

- Natural Language Classifier: Updates the trained classifier id used for testing.

- Speech to Text: Add support for setting customization_id parameter.

- Speech to Text: Added support for additional audio formats (`AudioMediaType.MuLaw` and `AudioMediaType.Basic`)

- Speech to Text: Added support for the `supported_features` parameter of language models, which identifies whether certain additional service features are supported with any given model.

- Speech to Text: Fix a bug where the microphone would continue recording when disconnected by the service (which also prevented the service from operating correctly when reconnecting).

- Text to Speech: Validate the status code in the response to `synthesize()`. This helps to produce more meaningful error messages when using incorrect credentials with the service.

- Visual Recognition: Any errors writing the JSON parameters file are now passed back to the user.

## Version 0.8.0

_2016-09-14_

This update adds support for Xcode 8 and Swift 2.3+.

## Version 0.7.2

_2016-10-12_

- All Services: Default HTTP headers can now be set for each service.
- Speech to Text: Add support for setting customization_id parameter.
- Visual Recognition: Any errors writing the JSON parameters file are now passed back to the user.

## Version 0.7.1

_2016-09-30_

The release updates the Swift 2.2 version of the iOS SDK with several bug fixes and minor changes.

- All Services: The service URL parameter was moved from each `init` to a class property. To set a custom service URL parameter, set the class property instead of passing it as a parameter to the initializer. (For example: `textToSpeech.serviceURL = "..."`.)

- Cartfile: The `Cartfile` was updated to explicitly specify Swift 2.2 compatible versions of the SDK's dependencies.

- Credentials: Testing credentials were moved to a .swift file for convenience.

- Language Translator: Update the default service URL for the recent release of the Language Translator service. To use an existing Language Translation service, specify a custom service URL.

- Natural Language Classifier: Updates the trained classifier id used for testing.

- Speech to Text: Added support for additional audio formats (`AudioMediaType.MuLaw` and `AudioMediaType.Basic`)

- Speech to Text: Added support for the `supported_features` parameter of language models, which identifies whether certain additional service features are supported with any given model.

- Speech to Text: Fix a bug where the microphone would continue recording when disconnected by the service (which also prevented the service from operating correctly when reconnecting).

- Text to Speech: Validate the status code in the response to `synthesize()`. This helps to produce more meaningful error messages when using incorrect credentials with the service.

## Version 0.7.0

_2016-09-11_

This update adds a new implementation for Speech to Text. The implementation includes a better, redesigned API. It also includes two separate classes, SpeechToText and SpeechToTextSession for simple and advanced usage, respectively. In particular, SpeechToTextSession exposes more control over the WebSockets session and microphone, including access to raw data and the decibel power level.

## Version 0.6.0

_2016-08-11_

This update adds the Retrieve and Rank service. It also adds re-training functionality to Visual Recognition and includes several minor documentation updates.

## Version 0.5.0

_2016-07-26_

This update adds the ConversationV1 service, along with the following minor updates:

- All Services: Add support for iOS 8+

- Alchemy Language: Change `forUrl` parameter to `forURL`
- Alchemy Vision: Deprecated in favor of Visual Recognition
- Relationship Extraction: Deprecated in favor of Alchemy Language
- Text To Speech: Add test for empty string
- Tone Analyzer: Update to the general availability URL

Note that the Alchemy Vision and Relationship Extraction services remain in the SDK. You can continue to use these services in your applications, but they will result in a deprecation build warning.

## Version 0.3.0

_2016-05-21_

The iOS-sdk version 0.3.0 has many major changes with this new release.  The team worked diligently at removing many of the third party dependencies and fully embracing AlamoFire by implementing the rest-kit code.  

**Major updates**

* Added IBM Watson Tone Analyzer
* Added IBM Watson Visual Recognition 
* Updated all of the code to use the new Rest-kit and removed NetworkUtils and WatsonGateway.  We still have one service to convert, Alchemy Language, but we anticipate that change coming in the next minor release.
* Removed many dependencies and reducing the total number to three.  Alamofire, Freddy, and Starscream.
* You will notice an update to the targets available and now the developer can pick and choose the services to include.

The process of migrating a service to Rest-kit required a large re-implementation of the service. As part of the reimplementation, we additionally gain:

* More consistent coding patterns between services.
* Better documentation.
* Better tests.
* Reorganized project structure to support Swift Package Manager.

In addition, the Rest-kit branch has a number of architectural changes that should make the SDK easier to maintain and easier to consume.  

* Uses Alamofire directly instead of NetworkUtils or WatsonGateway.
* Uses Freddy instead of ObjectMapper, allowing us to better express the models.
* Uses separate failure and success closures to avoid unwrapping optionals and enable consistent error handling.  We debated as a team as to the correct approach and concluded this was the best approach for the granularity.  One benefit is the user does not have to unwrap a response.  It also allows for a more unified error return.
